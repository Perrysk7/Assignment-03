QUESTION 1) 

Functions           Big-O 
2^n                 a^n  - Exponential 
3n + 51             n    - Linear 
100                 1    - Constant 
5n^3 + 5n - 10      a^3  - Cubic  
3log5n              logn - Logarithmic 


QUESTION 2) 

- I think that the maximum number of comparisions needed to perform a binary search 
on a list contaning 7 items is 3. Since in a binary search, the array would be divided 
into half every time.  

             7
         1       6
            2    2    2
           1 1  1 1  1 1

- As shown above, it takes 3 comparisions to split the 7 items individually. 


QUESTION 3) 

- I think that the Big-O value of this algorithm is linear because there is only
one for loop present in the code and the output of this code will return the user
a linear pattern.


QUESTION 4) 

- I think that selection sorting is little faster because insertion is only useful with smaller 
groups. Selection sorting would take a number and place it where it is suppose to 
be. That number will no longer be scanned for as it is now sorted. While insertion 
would go through every single number within a given series of numbers, and since 
this is a big series of numbers, we would have to go through the numbers we sorted.


QUESTION 5) 

- I think that the best theoretical Big-O runtime of a search algorithm is logarithmic
(log n) because it allows the user to just divide up a list until the user finds 
the item he or she was looking for.
